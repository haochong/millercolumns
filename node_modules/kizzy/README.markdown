# Kizzy - a Local Storage Utility

Kizzy is a light-weight, cross-browser, JavaScript local storage utility. It leverages the HTML5 localStorage API when available, as well as Internet Explorer's persistent XML store â€” wrapped up in a easy to use, memcached-like interface. When neither of these features are available (unlikely), it falls back to an in-browser object store.

It looks like this

``` js
var cache = kizzy('users')
var agent = cache.get('Agent')
if (agent) {
  alert('Welcome back ' + agent.name)
} else {
  cache.set('Agent', {
    name: 'Agent Diaz'
  })
}
```

Furthermore, a call to 'set' will return the value, making it quite easy for assignment.

``` js
var cache = kizzy('users')
var agent = cache.get('Agent') || cache.set('Agent', {
  name: 'Agent Diaz'
})
```

Lastly, you can pass an optional third argument to 'set' that tells the cache how long to live

``` js
var cache = kizzy('users')

var agent = cache.get('Agent') || cache.set('Agent', {
  name: 'Agent Diaz'
}, 5000) // time to live set for 5 seconds


// wait 3 seconds...
setTimeout(function() {
  alert('Still there ' + cache.get('Agent').name)
}, 3000)

// 6 seconds later...
setTimeout(function() {
  cache.get('Agent').name // => expired
}, 6000)
```

# Browser support

  * Internet Explorer 6+
  * Firefox 2+ (when localStorage is enabled (the browser default))
  * Chrome
  * Safari 4+
  * Opera

# Building Kizzy

``` sh
$ submodule update --init
& make
```

# Running tests

Tests will not currently pass if run on a file:/// protocol. Otherwise...

``` sh
$ open tests/test.html
```

# Ender integration

Install Kizzy as an Ender module

``` sh
$ ender add kizzy
```

Use it as such:

``` js
$.cache('user').get('name')
```

# Kizzy whu?

The name comes from Kunta Kinte, a Mandinka African warrior from the 1700's. After being brought into slavery, he had a daughter whom he named Kizzy, which translates to *stay put* in hopes that the family would stay together, but not stay a slave.

Happy Caching!
